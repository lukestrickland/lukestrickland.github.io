<b> Modelling Prospective Memory Lapses </b>
<br /> <br />
In our <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326878878_Racing_to_Remember_A_Theory_of_Decision_Control_in_Event-Based_Prospective_Memory">seminal paper modelling Prospective Memory</a>, we discussed
how it may be possible to use our model to identify lapses of memory.
Since then, I have implemented and tested the code to do that. The code is implemented 
in the <a href="https://osf.io/pbwx8/">Dynamic Models of Choice</a> (DMC) suite of functions. Press <a href={{ site.url }}/assets/lbaN_B_pmf.R>here</a> to download the model code. 
You will need to understand DMC to use the code, so check out the lessons provided in the link.
As with all custom DMC models, the user must 
add it to the 'models' directory. It is a variant of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243170">Linear Ballistic Accumulator </a> 
(LBA) model (Brown & Heathcote, 2008), and so it makes sense to store it in the LBA
subdirectory. As with all DMC model files, the code defines a transform, likelihood, and random function.
<br /> <br />
The memory lapse model is a modified version of the linear ballistic accumulator. Two things happen in the event of a memory failure: 1) the PM accumulator fails to run 
(e.g., in a three-choice task, that only the two ongoing task accumulators run), and 2) PM stimulus 
input will fail to inhibit ongoing task accumulation. Incorporating these failures requires modifications 
to the PMDC likelihood. The likelihood of PM responses is reduced in proportion to the probability of PM failure: 

$$L_P = (1-p_{pmf})f(t|\theta_P) \prod_{i=1}^nS(t|\theta_i)$$

\(L_P (t)\) refers to the probability of observing a PM response with decision time \(t\), 
where \(t\) is RT minus non-decision time. \(p_{pmf}\) is the probability of PM failure.
\(f(t│\theta_P )\) is the probability density that PM accumulator would reach threshold at time \(t\). 
\(S(t│\theta_i )\) is the probability that an ongoing task accumulator \(i\)  would reach threshold 
before time \(t\) (i.e., the survivor function), \(\prod_{i=1}^nS(t|\theta_i)\) and thus is the probability that 
none of the ongoing task accumulators \(i = 1 … n\)  would pre-empt the PM accumulator before time t. 

The likelihood of each ongoing task response i is a mixture of two scenarios, 
1) the scenario in which PM fails, and only the ongoing task accumulators race to
 threshold with no inhibition from PM inputs, and 2), the scenario in which the 
 PM accumulator is present and PM inputs can inhibit ongoing task accumulation. 
 
 $$L_i = p_{pmf}f(t|\theta_i) \prod_{j \ne i}S(t|\theta_j) +
 (1-p_{pmf})f(t|\theta_{i,inh})S(t|\theta_P) \prod_{j \ne i}S(t|\theta_{j,inh})
 $$
 
 Note that in the above \(L_i (t)\) refers to the probability of observing the ongoing task response 
 \(i\) with decision time \(t\). \(S(t|\theta_j)\) refers to the survivor function for any alternative ongoing 
 task response \(j\) in \(j… n\), and \(S(t|\theta_P)\) is the survivor function for the PM accumulator. 
 \(f(t|\theta_{i,inh})\) refers to the probability density of ongoing task accumulator \(i\) reaching 
 threshold at time \(t\), given possible inhibition from PM stimulus inputs, and \(S(t|\theta_{j,inh})\) 
 refers to the survivor function for any alternative ongoing task accumulators \(j\) in \(j… n\) , 
 given possible inhibition from PM stimulus inputs. On non-PM trials, 
 inhibition from PM stimulus inputs is fixed at 0.
