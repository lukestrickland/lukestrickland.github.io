	In our <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326878878_Racing_to_Remember_A_Theory_of_Decision_Control_in_Event-Based_Prospective_Memory">seminal paper modelling Prospective Memory</a>, we discussed
	how it may be possible to use our model to identify lapses of memory.
	Since then, I have implemented and tested the code to do that. The code is implemented 
	in the <a href="https://osf.io/pbwx8/">Dynamic Models of Choice</a> (DMC) suite of functions.
	<br /> <br />
	Press <a href={{ site.url }}/assets/lbaN_B_pmf.R>here</a> to download the model code. As with all custom DMC models, the user must 
	add it to the 'models' directory. It is a variant of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator 
	(LBA) model, and so it makes sense to store it in the LBA
	subdirectory. As with all DMC model files, the code defines a transform, likelihood, and random function.
	Below I go through the code piece by piece.
