Michael David Wilson, Timothy Ballard and I have recently released the <a href=https://github.com/humanfactors/FIPS>Fatigue Impairment Prediction Suite</a>, an 
open source R package implementing biomathematical models of fatigue. In addition to the front-facing package content, we are actively developing and testing
Bayesian parameter estimation of fatigue models using Stan.

Michael gives a brief speech on FIPS and some potential applications for applied research below.
