Embedded within this analysis is a recognition of the complexity of the behavior under discussion. The authors begin with a review of methods for measuring adherence behavior. This is followed by a brief discussion of the relationship of important constructs from the domains of health psychology and behavioral medicine to an understanding of medication adherence. Following this, the role of retrospective memory in medication adherence is briefly reviewed, and prospective memory issues are discussed in detail. Cognitive intervention techniques to improve medication adherence are then described. The authors close this chapter with recommendations for future directions of research in this area that emphasize an integration of cognitive research with other domains of psychology.

ABSTRACT={Adaptive behavior requires the ability to flexibly control actions. This can occur either proactively to anticipate task requirements, or reactively in response to sudden changes. In this article, we describe the behavioral and physiological evidence for dual mechanisms of control in response inhibition in the medial frontal cortex in the context of the stop signal or countermanding task.}

The participants were 12 individuals with severe long-term TBI and 12 community controls. Participants were asked to answer general-knowledge questions on a computer for two sessions. The time- and event-based tasks were embedded in this filler activity. Participants were also required to carry out activity-based actions at the end of the two sessions. Participants with TBI performed significantly worse than did controls on all three prospective-memory tasks, indicating that TBI affects not only retrospective but also prospective memory. Implications of these results for the assessment and rehabilitation of memory problems in individuals with TBI are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with Parkinson’s disease have been reported to have retrospective memory impairment, while prospective memory, which is memory for actions to be performed in the future, has not yet been investigated.
Objective: To investigate the prospective memory of patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Methods: Twenty Parkinson’s disease patients and 20 age matched normal controls were given event based and time based prospective memory tasks. In the event based prospective memory task, the subject was asked to perform an action whenever particular words were presented. In the time based prospective memory task, the subject was asked to perform an action at certain times.
Results: The Parkinson’s disease patients were impaired on the event based prospective memory task but not on the time based prospective memory task. The impairment of the Parkinson’s disease patients on the event based prospective memory task was not the result of their forgetting the content of the prospective memory instructions, but the result of their failure to retrieve it spontaneously when the target words appeared.
Conclusions: These results suggest that event based prospective memory is impaired in patients with Parkinson’s disease, presumably relating to frontal lobe dysfunction.},

The problem of reproducibility can be alleviated by computational modeling, which maximizes correspondence between the actual behavior of a posited system and its behavior inferred through reasoning and increases the fidelity of communication of our theories to others.},

The influence of subjective importance (high, low) and type of intention (educational, internal, external) on the (missed) execution of intention was investigated in a 2 × 2 design. The effects on missed executions by importance (high {\textless} low) and type of intention (educational {\textless} external {\textless} internal) were hypothesized. Of 73 valid intentions in 40 prepared simulator scenarios 19 (26\%) were missed overall. A total of 64\% of unimportant and 80\% of important intentions were executed 79\% of educational 67\% of external and 72\% of internal intentions were executed. Neither difference was statistically significant using χ2 tests. Interaction was significant for missed executions (p = 0.025; n = 19; df = 2; χ2 = 7.41) and for executions (p = 0.002; n = 54; df = 2; χ2 = 12.50). Despite low statistical support and some methodological limitations, it was possible to show that PM failures are relevant to patient safety and that patient simulators are a suitable but so far unused tool for their investigation.},

	shorttitle = {Memory for {Action}},
	abstract = {The book presents in eight chapters our actual knowledge on memory for actions and it gives room to the proponents of the opposing models to develop their view for explaining action memory. In Chapter one, Hubert Zimmer and Ronald Cohen summarize the results of laboratory research on action, i. e. memory for self-performed actions. In Chapter two, Melissa Guynn, Mark McDaniel and Gilles Einstein extend this field on memory for intended actions. They present their view on the prospective memory of actions, and they demonstrate the importance of automatic retrieval in prospective memory. In the following chapter, Johannes Engelkamp presents his motor oriented explanation of action memory. He claims that output processes strongly contribute to memory for performed actions, and that the information which is critical for memory is closely related to the information used in the motor control of overt performance. Reza Kormi-Nouri and Lars-Goran Nilsson (Chapter four) completely disagree with this position. They argue that performing actions may cause specific processes, but that nevertheless action memory is part of a unique episodic memory which stores all types of episodes in a similar way. In the following chapter, Mary Ann Foley and Hilary Ratner put action memory in the broader context of activity memory. Everyday actions are usually performed in social contexts and they are goal-oriented. This aspect is seldom relevant in laboratory research, but the authors show that it is of importance for everyday memory. Then two brief chapters follow in which Nilsson and Kormi-Nouri on the one hand, and Engelkamp on the other hand mutually comment on each others position. In the closing chapter, Hubert Zimmer discusses the presented different attempts in parallel. He is doing this by taking into account the different processes and brain modules which are necessary for a successful control of actions.},

An independent measures design utilising pre-existing groups of users and non-users was employed in which an opportunity sample of 90 undergraduates studying at universities in the north east of England participated. The number of prospective memory failures reported on the Prospective Memory Questionnaire and the number of location—action combinations correctly recalled during a video-based prospective memory task were measured. The number of strategies used to assist memory, level of anxiety and depression, and use of alcohol, nicotine and any other recreational drugs in addition to cannabis were also measured and controlled during the analysis. Analysis revealed no significant differences in the number of self-reported prospective memory failures; however, cannabis users recalled significantly fewer location—action combinations than non-users in the video-based prospective memory task. The findings from the present study suggest that cannabis use has a detrimental effect on prospective memory ability in young adults but users may not be aware of these deficits.},
