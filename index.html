	I'm Luke. I'm a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Future of Work Institute, Curtin University.

	<br /> <br />
	I'm a scientist and computational modeller. My research includes basic cognitive science,
	use-inspired human factors research, and biomathematical modelling of human fatigue to inform rostering
	and workforce decisions. I often try to integrate these fields of research. For example, I have developed computational cognitive models
	to help understand the psychological processes underlying conflict detection in air traffic control.
	<br /> <br />
	
	I'm passionate about quantitative methods. I am an avid user of R and Python, particularly R.
