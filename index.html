	Luke Strickland is a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Future of Work Institute, Curtin University.

	<br /> <br />
	Luke applies biomathematical models of human fatigue to inform rostering
	and workforce decisions. His research spans cognitive science, human factors, 
	and quantitative methods. For example, he has developed computational models
	to help understand the psychological processes underlying conflict detection in air traffic control. 
	<br /> <br />
	
	Luke contributes to R software projects designed to facilitate <a href=" http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.02340">biomathematical modelling</a>
	and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1067-y">cognitive modelling</a>.
