	I'm Luke. I'm a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Future of Work Institute, Curtin University.

	<br /> <br />
	I'm a scientist and computational modeller. In my current role, I apply biomathematical models of human fatigue to inform rostering
	and workforce decisions. My research spans cognitive science, human factors, 
	and quantitative methods. For example, I have developed computational models
	to help understand the psychological processes underlying conflict detection in air traffic control. 
	<br /> <br />
	
	I am an avid user of R and Python, particularly R. I contribute to R software projects designed to facilitate <a href=" http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.02340">biomathematical modelling</a>
	and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1067-y">cognitive modelling</a>.
