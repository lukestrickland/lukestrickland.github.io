	Hi! I'm Luke. I'm a scientist who develops computational models of cognition. I currently research and teach 
	at the University of Western Australia.

	<br /> <br />
	I am pursuing several streams of basic cognitive research. For example, I examine 'Prospective Memory', the cognitive processes required to perform deferred actions in the future
	(e.g., to remember to pick up milk on the way home). I also examine inhibitory control, the processes required to voluntarily inhibit or regulate prepotent action 
	(e.g., to stop yourself from scratching an itch). 
	<br /> <br />
	
	I regularly translate basic cognitive science into applied science. For example, I have developed computational models
	to help understand the cognitive control and prospective memory processes underlying conflict detection in air traffic control.
	
		
	<br /> <br />
	I'm passionate about statistics. I focus on developing and testing comprehensive cognitive process models with Bayesian methods. I typically work in
	R and Python.
